"description": "http://svalbard.money is a Norwegian ordinal-project initiated by SpareBank 1; the second largest finance group in Norway. The fascinating monetary history in Svalbard constitutes the core of the project: In the 20th century, American, British, Norwegian, Russian/Soviet and Swedish coal companies issued local currencies in Svalbard; notes and (Soviet) coins; money based upon real mining and physical proof of work.\n\nSpareBank 1's bitcoin ordinals pay homage to the memory of the Anglo-Russian Grumant Company, Ltd. In the 1920s this company produced both coal and money in Grumant City in Svalbard. These ordinals are inscribed with a) a typeface inspired by Soviet monetary design, and b) text copied from a 'bank note' issued by Anglo-Russian Grumant Co. in 1921. (Noregs Bank - the central bank of Norway - today owns the sole original note of this kind.)",
