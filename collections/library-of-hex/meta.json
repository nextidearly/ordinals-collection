  "description": "64 unique pairs of collectible spellbooks minted to both the bitcoin and Ethereum blockchains. One for each permutation of Hex’s elemental dimensions (🌀 Flow 💥 Turmoil 💎 Zuànshí) and worldcrafting tools (🔮 Aethereal 🦠 Biocypher 🔱 Nextech).\n\n“When Hex, Mother of Worlds, transcended to the beyond, wars raged over the knowledge hidden within her divine library. The spellbooks passed from sorcerer to apprentice, monarch to heir, defeated to victor. Those who mastered Hex’s inscriptions gained god-like powers, using them for miraculous good, devastating evil, and all that lies between.”\n\nZed Zeroth, an established British-licensed cryptoasset vendor, brings this groundbreaking collection to life with traditional pen-and-paper worldbuilding, digital graphic design, cutting-edge AI enhancement, and Bitcoin inscription technology.",
